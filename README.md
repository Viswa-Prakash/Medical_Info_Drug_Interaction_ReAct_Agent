#  Medical Information and Drug Interaction Advisor

This is a ReAct-style AI agent designed to provide **reliable medical information** about drugs, symptoms, potential interactions, and general usage guidance. Built with **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **Streamlit**, it intelligently selects the best search or knowledge tool to answer your medical questions in real-time.

## Features

-  Identifies medicines related to symptoms
-  Detects potential drug interactions
-  Suggests usage guidance, dosage, and side effects
-  Uses multiple web tools (Google, Serper, Wikipedia, Tavily) for up-to-date info
-  ReAct-style loop with tool reasoning and controlled flow
-  Streamlit-based interactive UI

##  How It Works

The agent follows a **Reasoning + Acting (ReAct)** paradigm with memory of conversation. Here's the step-by-step flow:

1. **LLM (OpenAI GPT-4.1)** reasons based on user input.
2. Selects the most relevant tool:
   - `Serper` for general medical queries
   - `Google` for updated web searches
   - `Wikipedia` for encyclopedic knowledge
   - `Tavily` for summarized recent articles
3. Executes the tool call if needed.
4. Loops until a **Final Answer** is generated.
5. Ends the session after max steps or when a final summary is ready.
